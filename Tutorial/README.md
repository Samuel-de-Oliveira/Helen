# How to build



#### Purpose of this project:

In this project an obstacle detection system will be built with Arduino. This system mainly uses an ultrasound sensor, buzzer, LCD and LED.





#### Necessary components

   - Arduino UNO
   - ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04/HC-SR05)
   - buzzer
   - 1 resistance 220Î©
   - 1 red LED
   - LCD display
   - connecting wires


#### Here's the steps of the project:

**Step 1**

DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ARDUINO IDE FROM THE <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software"> PORTAL.</a>

**Step 2 (Mounting)**

To make the assembly, we can connect :

**For LED and buzzer:**

- the terminals (+) of the red LED and buzzer to the digital pin 1 of  Arduino.

- the (-) terminals of the red LED and buzzer at the GND pin of  Arduino.


**For HC-SR04 / HC-SR05 sensor:**

- TRIG pin to pin 2 of Arduino

- Echo pin tp pin 3 of Arduino.

- VCC pin to 3.3V of Arduino

- GND pin to GND of Arduino


**For the LCD display:**

- the SDA pin at the Arduino analog pin A4.

- the SCL pin at the Arduino analog pin A5.

- the VCC pin at the Arduino 5v pin.

- the GND pin at the Arduino GND pin
