# How to build your own Helen device?
First you should understand that the project have many others distinct codes, because we want to adapt the project to any kind of sensor or microcontroller, this will make it more accessible to everyone.

---
### Where do I start?
The first step is know what is the project you'd like to build based in the sensor and in the microcontroller.

For example, to build the project with the Arduino UNO/Nano with the `HC-SR04` sensor you may choose the `Helen_Single_HC-SR04` project version.

If you'd like to make the project from scratch (You'd like to search all the materials needed and build it), you may choose any version, because for each one has a list with all required components for the building. We recommend you build the `Helen_Single_HC-SR04` version.

### Versions of the project
Just click on the project you'd like to build and you'll be redirected to the tutorial of it.

##### For Arduino UNO/Nano
- [Helen Single HC-SR04](/Helen_Single_HC-SR04/Tutorial/README.md);
- [Helen Single HC-SR05](/Helen_Single_HC-SR05/README.md).

> <small> More versions will come soon </small>
