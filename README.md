# The Helen project
### What is it?
The Helen project is a equipment that help people with vision
disabilities to detect things in them front with sounds or vibration.
The project can be used in a cap, hat, t-shirt, hands or anything in
the body. And it's totaly Open Source, it means that's more accessible
to anyone who wants the equipment, only just having a relative or friend
create it with the materials they have.
