# The Helen project
### What is it?
The Helen project is equipment that helps people with vision
disabilities and hearing disabilities to detect things in the front with sounds or vibrations,
 it also displays the distance of the object on an LCD screen.

The project can be used in a cap, hat, t-shirt, hands, or anything on
the body. And it's Open Source, which means that's more accessible
to anyone who wants the equipment, only just having a relative or friend
create it with the materials they have.

Look how this work in this small video:

- The video is on production :construction:

This project has more than one version, here are all versions:

- [Single HC-SR04](Helen_Single_HC-SR04/);
- [Single HC-SR05](Helen_Single_HC-SR05/);
- Two HC-SR04 (Coming soon).

**Note** `HC-SR04` and `HC-SR05` work pretty similarly.
